# Bounsight – Design & Dev Document (MVP → V1)

> **⚠️ HISTORICAL DOCUMENT**
>
> This document was created during development to guide implementation. Now that features are built, see **[README.md](../README.md)** for current documentation describing what exists and how it works.
>
> This file is kept for historical reference only.

**One-liner:** A minimalist, cross-platform bounce game that reveals a short, insightful message **one word per bounce**. You draw temporary spring lines; the mascot (a falling ball/character) hits them, speaks the next word, and the line appears on screen with haptics. Messages are pushed from a simple admin page and sync to Web, iOS, and Android.

This document is a blueprint for emergent gameplay and development feel, not a rigid spec. The architecture is designed to support rapid iteration and tuning until the vibe is right.

## 0) Goals & Principles

### Why (creative intent)
- A playful vehicle for two brothers to express themselves and share messages they care about with people.
- The platform doubles as a tiny stage for our words while we make a fun, simple game—the medium we enjoy building.
- Repetition via play helps a message "settle in." The loop is meditative and affirmative without feeling like a lecture.

### Development Principles
- **Vibe-code friendly:** Keep the tech stack minimal and flexible. No heavy frameworks or complex build pipelines. Direct manipulation of physics constants, immediate visual feedback.
- **Universal updates:** Server-side message and content updates that deploy instantly to all platforms. No app store submissions for content changes.
- **Radical simplicity:** Bias toward the simplest solution that works. Every feature and line of code must justify its existence.
- **Lightweight everything:** Small bundle sizes, minimal dependencies, fast load times. Use the smallest tool that solves the problem well—but if a larger library is truly necessary for core functionality (like Matter.js for physics), that's fine as long as total weight stays reasonable.
- **Single source of truth:** One codebase, one physics engine, one set of constants. Platform-specific code only for rendering and native APIs.
- **Clean modularity:** Components and modules should have clear, single responsibilities and live in their own spaces. Easy to find, easy to adjust, easy to reason about. But don't over-architect—modularize when it makes sense, not preemptively.
- **No bloat:** Resist feature creep. The game is about bouncing and hearing words. Everything else is secondary.

## 1) Player Experience

### Core loop
1. The mascot (ball/character) falls under gravity.
2. The player **draws a short line** (swipe). That line becomes a **springboard**.
3. On contact, the mascot bounces. **Each bounce speaks and displays the next word** of the message.
4. After the final word, the message **repeats** word-by-word on subsequent bounces. Height is a side effect; the message is the point.

### Controls
- **Create springboard (AKA "Gelato"):** Two methods:
  - **Swipe:** Swipe in any direction to instantly create a Gelato (straight line) in that direction
  - **Draw:** Touch and drag to draw; you'll see a preview path that follows your finger movement (see Drawing Mechanics below)

### Drawing Mechanics Implementation (TBD through experimentation)

**Core behavior (fixed):**
- Maximum distance allowed between start and end points (`maxGelatoLength`)
- On finger release: Always creates a straight-line Gelato between final start and end points
- Preview is purely visual feedback; final physics object is always a straight line

**Approach 1: Continuous Path with Sliding Start**
- Draw a continuous curved line following exact finger movement
- Start point begins where finger first touches
- When finger distance exceeds `maxGelatoLength`, start point slides along the historical path
- Maintains a "tail" of the most recent `maxGelatoLength` worth of path
- Visual: Smooth curved line, possibly with gradient fade on the older parts

**Approach 2: Segmented Printing (Bounce Sir style)**
- Instead of continuous line, "print" discrete segments at intervals along the path
- Each segment starts thin and expands to full size based on finger distance
- Within threshold distance: Current segment resizes and rotates toward finger
- Beyond threshold: Segment gets "printed" (locked in place), new segment begins
- When max length exceeded: Oldest segments disappear, maintaining the tail
- Visual: Series of connected segments (dots, capsules, or short lines)

**Key decisions to make during implementation:**
- Segment trigger distance (how far finger moves before printing new segment)
- Visual representation of "active" vs "printed" segments
- Smoothing/interpolation between finger samples for continuous feel
- How aggressively start point slides when exceeding max length
- Whether to show dotted/solid/gradient for different parts of preview

**Why this complexity matters:**
The preview mechanics directly impact game feel. Too responsive and it feels twitchy; too sluggish and it feels unresponsive. The segmented approach might feel more "intentional" while continuous might feel more "fluid." Only playtesting will reveal the right approach.

### Bouncing Mechanics

**Bounce direction:**
- Mascot bounces perpendicular to the Gelato's angle (along the normal vector)
- Not just "up" - if Gelato is angled, bounce direction matches that angle
- Creates more strategic placement opportunities

**Bounce strength:**
- Base restitution from Matter.js physics (tunable)
- Additional "spring boost" impulse applied on contact (tunable)
- Combined force determines bounce height/distance

**Wall behavior:**
- Configurable as either:
  - **Hard boundaries:** Mascot bounces off walls with restitution
  - **Wrap-around:** Mascot exits one side, enters the other (portal-style)
- Decision made via config constant

**Gravity:**
- Constant downward force (`gravityY`)
- Tunable strength affects fall speed and arc
- Consider range: 0.5 (floaty) to 2.0 (heavy)

**Air resistance:**
- `frictionAir` parameter prevents infinite acceleration
- Creates terminal velocity naturally
- Tunable for different feel (0.01 = slippery, 0.05 = dampened)

**Multiple bounce prevention:**
- Debounce timer (`minBounceIntervalMs`) prevents double-bouncing
- After bouncing a Gelato, brief immunity period before it can trigger again
- Prevents physics glitches and unintended multi-hits

**Velocity capping:**
- Maximum speed limits for X and Y velocity
- Prevents mascot from breaking camera bounds or physics engine
- Safety valve for extreme player inputs or physics edge cases

### Feedback
- **Visual:** the spoken word appears in the **center of the screen** on each bounce; gentle fade/float.
- **Haptic:**
  - Line placed → light tick.
  - Bounce/word reveal → medium impact.
- **Audio:** character voice says the word (see Voice System). Soft bounce SFX (optional, low-volume under voice).

### Progression (lightweight)
- The playfield scrolls upward as you keep bouncing; we track **height** (how far up you've climbed) as a light, score-like counter. It stays minimal and secondary to the message loop.

### Aesthetic
- Dark-mode, almost **MS-DOS-like** minimalism; clean typography and restrained palette.
- **Monospace-style** vibe (inspired by the "Monospace" notes app): ultra-simple UI with occasional, tasteful moments of fluidity/beauty.
- **Mascot:** a simple circle **with a face**, small talking mouth animations and a few expressions. The mascot is explicitly the **speaker** of the words. Face implementation TBD during development—may use Skia paths, sprites, or simple geometric shapes.

---

## 2) Content & Voice System

### Message definition
- **Message**: short sentence/line of wisdom.
- Stored as text; tokenized into **words** (see normalization).
- Each bounce advances `wordIndex = (wordIndex + 1) % words.length`.

### Normalization & tokenization
- Lowercase for audio reuse cache (preserve case where we want stylistic capitalization in metadata).
- **Message storage:** Store original message with punctuation in `current-message.json`. Strip punctuation only for display and audio lookup at runtime.
- Contractions treated as single words (e.g., "don't").
- **Punctuation interjections:** Map major stops (period, em-dash, ellipsis) to pre-recorded interjection sounds ("hm", "ah", etc.). These are system sounds recorded once and stored with message audio. No on-screen glyph for punctuation.

### Audio recording & storage (Recording-first approach) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Workflow:** Admin records the full message phrase in the admin UI using device microphone (expo-audio).
- **Format:** Audio recorded as `.m4a` (AAC format) on iOS/Android, `.webm` on web.
- **Processing:** Audio uploaded to `/api/align` endpoint (Vercel serverless function).
- **Word boundary detection:** Energy-based RMS envelope analysis detects precise word boundaries (5-10ms accuracy).
- **Speech-to-text:** Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API transcribes the audio (text only, no timestamps).
- **Alignment:** 1:1 matching of transcribed words to detected energy segments.
- **Voice transformation (optional):** ElevenLabs Speech-to-Speech API can transform voice to character voices (Reboundhi/Reboundhita).
- **Storage:**
  - Original audio: `message-audio/{date}.m4a` in GitHub repo
  - Transformed audio (if enabled): Blob URIs stored in session (base64 from API)
  - Word timings: Stored in `messages.json` with text and words array
- **Data structure:**
  ```json
  {
    "2025-11-29": {
      "text": "you are loved",
      "words": ["you", "are", "loved"],
      "audioUrl": "message-audio/2025-11-29.m4a",
      "wordTimings": [
        {"word": "you", "start": 0, "end": 300},
        {"word": "are", "start": 420, "end": 615},
        {"word": "loved", "start": 730, "end": 1180}
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

### Client playback ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Load message audio on startup**: Single `.m4a` file per message with word timing metadata.
- **Playback mechanism**: expo-audio's `createAudioPlayer()` with seekTo() and play() for precise segment control (cross-platform).
- **Word audio queue**: Each bounce triggers:
  1. `audioPlayer.seekTo(wordTiming.start / 1000)` - Jump to word start time (convert ms to seconds)
  2. `audioPlayer.play()` - Start playback
  3. `setTimeout(() => audioPlayer.pause(), duration)` - Stop at word end time
- **Voice switching**: Can cycle between transformed voices (Reboundhi/Reboundhita) by tapping ball in preview mode.
- **Audio trimming**: `config.audio.trimStartMs` (default: 120ms) trims leading silence from each word segment.

### Storage & CDN ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Message audio:** `message-audio/{date}.m4a` stored in GitHub repo alongside `messages.json`
- **Transformed audio:** Generated on-demand via ElevenLabs API, returned as base64, converted to blob URIs for session playback (not persisted)
- **No CDN:** Audio files served directly from GitHub repo via raw.githubusercontent.com URLs
- **Caching:** Browser caches audio files naturally via HTTP caching headers from GitHub
- Optional: bundle a tiny on-device cache by LRU to minimize repeat fetches.

## 3) Physics & Feel

### Engine
- **Matter.js (2D)** for physics
  - **Why:** Provides fine-grained control over restitution, friction, gravity, and impulse forces without the overhead of a full game engine. At 88kb, it's worth not debugging custom physics edge cases. Gives us the polish potential we need for great game feel while staying lightweight.
  - Use Matter.js's default runner for simplicity unless performance issues arise.

### Entities
- **Mascot (dynamic body):** circle; `restitution`, `frictionAir`, `mass` tunables.
- **Gelato (static/kinematic bodies):** created from swipes: a short rectangle aligned to gesture angle (length clamp, thickness).
- **Bounds:** **optional** left/right walls; we may experiment with **horizontal wrap** vs. hard bounds.

### Gelato behavior
- Contact with a Gelato triggers:
  - Normal physics bounce via restitution.
  - **Additional impulse** along the Gelato's normal (configurable "springiness").
  - Haptic + voice word emit + visual word popup.
- **Gelato lifetime rules:**
  - A Gelato **destructs after it's been bounced on once**, **or**
  - If a **new Gelato** is created while one exists, the previous Gelato is destroyed immediately.
  - Otherwise, the Gelato persists (no time-based auto-destruct).

### Tunable constants (expose in config.js at root)
- `gravityY`
- `restitution`, `friction`, `frictionAir`
- Gelato: `maxLength`, `thickness`, `springBoost`, `maxActiveGelatos`
- Bounce cadence guards: `minBounceIntervalMs`
- Haptics strengths per event
- Audio ducking: voice vs SFX ratio

> **Note:** All constants are **TBD and exploratory**. The feel will emerge through playtesting. The system is designed to be **expandable, swappable, and highly tweakable**—these are starting points, not final values.

---

## 4) Cross-Platform Rendering & Performance

### Single Renderer Architecture
- **React Native Skia everywhere** - one rendering codebase for all platforms
  - **Why:** Maintains our "single source of truth" principle. Change the ball color once, it updates on iOS, Android, and Web. No duplicate drawing logic. Skia is battle-tested (powers Chrome and Flutter) and gives us native performance with a unified API.
  - Mobile: Native Skia via `@shopify/react-native-skia`
  - Web: Same API via CanvasKit WASM (~2MB, acceptable trade-off for unified rendering)

### Frame loop
- `requestAnimationFrame` (Web) / Native Skia loop (Mobile)
- 60 FPS baseline with 120 FPS where device supports
- Avoid React state in hot loops; use refs/imperative stores

### Target
- Smooth, consistent experience across all platforms
- No visual differences between web and mobile
- Minimal bundle impact (CanvasKit is our biggest web dependency at ~2MB)

---

## 5) Architecture (End-to-End)

### Overview
- **Clients (Web, iOS, Android)** fetch the **current message** from GitHub repo.
- **In-app admin** (gestural password) lets creators update the message directly in the game.
- Message updates via GitHub API; no separate backend needed for MVP.
- Audio uses recording-first approach: record message → automatic transcription → word segmentation → playback.
- Clients cache message for offline play.

### Suggested stack

**Core Technologies & Why We Chose Them:**

- **App Framework: Expo (React Native) + react-native-web**
  - **Why:** Single codebase for iOS, Android, and Web. Expo handles the painful parts of React Native (build configs, native modules) while still giving us truly native apps. Yes, there's some development overhead (Metro bundler quirks, longer build times) but it's worth it for genuine native performance and feel (proper haptics, low-latency audio).

- **Physics: Matter.js**
  - **Why:** Sweet spot between control and simplicity. Gives us tweakable restitution, friction, gravity—all the micro-details for game feel—without a bloated game engine. At 88kb, it's light enough to vibe-code with but robust enough to handle edge cases we haven't thought of.

- **Renderer: React Native Skia (everywhere)**
  - **Why:** Single rendering codebase = single source of truth. Using `@shopify/react-native-skia` on mobile and CanvasKit (WASM) on web means we draw once and it looks identical everywhere. No maintaining two drawing implementations. The 2MB web bundle cost is worth the simplicity.

- **Haptics: expo-haptics + Web Vibration API**
  - **Why:** Native haptic feedback is crucial for game feel. Expo's API is simple and falls back gracefully on web. Note: Web haptics will be basic (simple vibration) compared to native's rich haptic patterns.

- **Audio: expo-audio (cross-platform)**
  - **Why:** expo-audio provides unified API for both recording and playback across web, iOS, and Android. Low-latency audio with precise seekTo() support for word segment playback. Eliminates need for multiple audio libraries.

- **Message Storage: GitHub Repo**
  - **Why:** Zero setup, free hosting for `current-message.json`. Built-in version control. GitHub API allows in-app updates via token. Global CDN for fast fetches. Eliminates need for separate backend infrastructure in MVP.

- **Audio: Recording-first approach**
  - **Why:** Authentic voice quality from creator recordings. Record once → auto-transcribe → segment words → playback. No AI generation costs. Personal touch from real human voice.

### Data model (minimal) ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Messages:** `messages.json` file in GitHub repo containing multiple dated messages:
  ```json
  {
    "current": "2025-11-29",
    "messages": {
      "2025-11-29": {
        "text": "you are loved",
        "words": ["you", "are", "loved"],
        "audioUrl": "message-audio/2025-11-29.m4a",
        "wordTimings": [
          {"word": "you", "start": 0, "end": 300},
          {"word": "are", "start": 420, "end": 615},
          {"word": "loved", "start": 730, "end": 1180}
        ]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Audio files:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Stored as `message-audio/{date}.m4a` in GitHub repo
- **Storage approach:** No database, no relations, no complex state management
- **Why this simplicity:** We're not storing user data or message history beyond a simple calendar. Just a collection of dated messages that all clients fetch. Git provides version history for free.

### In-app admin (see Section 9 for details)
- Hidden gestural password (staircase pattern) unlocks admin UI
- Simple text area for new message
- Submit updates `current-message.json` via GitHub API
- All users get new message on next app launch

### Message fetch policy (client)
- Fetch `current-message.json` from GitHub on app start
- Cache for offline play
- No polling or real-time updates needed

### Build & release
- One repo; EAS (Expo) for native builds; Vercel/Netlify for web
- No app update needed for new messages; content pulled at runtime from GitHub

class GameCore {
  world: Matter.World
  mascot: Body
  gelatos: Body[]
  wordIndex = 0
  words: string[]
  onWord?: (word: string) => void

  step(dtMs: number) {
    // Use Matter.js default runner, don't overcomplicate
    Engine.update(engine, dtMs)
  }

  onCollision(a, b) {
    if (isMascotAndGelato(a, b) && debounceOK()) {

export function GameRenderer({ gameState }) {
  return (
    <Canvas style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {/* Mascot with face (implementation TBD) */}
      <Circle 
        cx={gameState.mascot.x} 
        cy={gameState.mascot.y} 
        r={30} 
        color="#69e"
      />
      {/* Face details to be added - may use Path or sprites */}
      
      {/* Gelatos */}
      {gameState.gelatos.map((gelato) => (
        <Line
          p1={vec(gelato.start.x, gelato.start.y)}
          p2={vec(gelato.end.x, gelato.end.y)}
          color="white"
          style="stroke"
          strokeWidth={4}
        />
      ))}
    </Canvas>
  )
}
```

### VoiceQueue (sketch)
```ts
class VoiceQueue {
  preload(words: string[]) { /* fetch & decode buffers */ }
  speak(word: string) { /* enqueue buffer; play if idle */ }
}
```

---

## 8) Haptics & Audio Details

### Haptics map (MVP)
- Gelato placed: `Impact Light`
- Bounce/word reveal: `Impact Medium`
- Tall combo (optional): `Notification Success`

### Audio priorities
- Voice is primary; bounce SFX subtle, side-chained or ducked.
- Prevent overlap: if another bounce occurs mid-word, either queue or truncate (configurable).
- Volume normalization per word during generation or at first decode.

---

## 9) In-App Admin Architecture

### Design Rationale

Admin functionality lives directly in the game app rather than a separate web portal. This means message updates happen within the game itself—no context switching, no separate deployment. The admin UX is as simple as the player UX.

### Gestural Password: The Staircase

Authentication is performed through gameplay rather than traditional credentials. The unlock pattern: **5 consecutive bounces where each bounce is progressively higher on screen AND each Gelato is progressively shorter (≥20% narrower each time).**

This approach:
- Uses existing game mechanics (no separate auth UI)
- Requires intentional skill to execute (won't happen accidentally)
- Feels like discovering a secret rather than logging in
- Even if reverse-engineered, must be physically performed

### Architecture

**Client-side (baked into app):**
- Staircase validation logic
- Admin UI components (hidden)
- GitHub API token

**Server-side (GitHub repo):**
- `current-message.json` (fetched by all users)

**Why split this way:**
The message must live outside the app so updates don't require app store resubmission or user reinstalls. The admin validation can live client-side because only 1-2 trusted admins exist, and the staircase pattern provides sufficient obscurity for this use case.

**Trade-offs:**
- Security through obscurity (not cryptographically secure)
- GitHub token discoverable if app is decompiled
- Client-side validation rules visible in source

These trade-offs are acceptable for a small creative project. Worst case: someone posts a silly message (revertable via git). The GitHub token is rotatable if compromised.

### Flow

**Players:**
1. Launch app → fetch `current-message.json` from GitHub → play

**Admins:**
1. Launch app → draw staircase pattern → admin panel appears → submit new message → GitHub file updates → all users get new message on next launch

### Implementation Sketch

```javascript
// Track last 5 bounces
this.recentBounces = []; // { y, gelatoWidth, timestamp }

onBounce(gelatoWidth) {
  this.recentBounces.push({
    y: this.mascot.position.y,
    gelatoWidth: gelatoWidth,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  if (this.recentBounces.length > 5) this.recentBounces.shift();
  if (this.validateStaircase(this.recentBounces)) this.onAdminUnlock();
}

validateStaircase(bounces) {
  if (bounces.length < 5) return false;
  // Each bounce higher (Y decreasing)
  for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    if (bounces[i].y >= bounces[i-1].y) return false;
  }
  // Each gelato narrower (≤80% of previous)
  for (let i = 1; i < 5; i++) {
    if (bounces[i].gelatoWidth >= bounces[i-1].gelatoWidth * 0.8) return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

GitHub API updates message file directly via token. Message tokenized into words array for consistency.

### Future Options

**If stronger security needed:** Migrate to Cloudflare Workers for server-side validation, move token to backend.

**If Apple flags hidden UI:** Make "Admin" button visible in settings (still gated by staircase), or note it in review comments as content management for authorized users.

**Additional obscurity:** Time-based unlock windows, multi-stage patterns, velocity/timing requirements.

This approach prioritizes simplicity and admin UX over maximum security—appropriate for a 2-person creative project.
